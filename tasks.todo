Now:
  ✔ add Cypress testing, and remove any Jest UI testing @done(20-04-10 22:37)
    have Jest tests for the following
    ☐ test functions
    ☐ test clipboard
    ☐ test tabbing
    ☐ test downloading
  ☐ make header a link to '/'
  ☐ check out small screen responsiveness

Future:
☐ have some script to run `scripts/get-schemes` automatically, each week or so

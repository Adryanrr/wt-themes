### Info

All the themes are copied from [iTerm2-Color-Schemes](https://github.com/mbadolato/iTerm2-Color-Schemes). So thanks and credit to them and all the theme designers.

To use, open up Windows Terminal settings (a file called `profile.json` will open), copy a theme from this site into the `schemes` section and then reference the name your chosen profile in the `profiles` section.

Notes
